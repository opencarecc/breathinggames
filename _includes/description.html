  <h2>Our core values</h2>
  <p>
	  We create educational and therapeutic games, devices to measure the breathe, and distributed data systems to inform public health practices, and policies.
	  We create a commons – collectively managed resources that are freely accessible and can be used and enriched by everyone – by spurring collaboration between people affected,
	  caregivers, and passionate professionals to build on the collective intelligence.
